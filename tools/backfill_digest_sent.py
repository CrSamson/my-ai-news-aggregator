"""
tools/backfill_digest_sent.py - one-shot, run ONCE after deploying the
digest_sent_at column.

Stamps `digest_sent_at = NOW()` on every row of articles / papers that
already has a non-empty summary. The reasoning: those rows were ingested
+ summarised before the column existed, so they are already in past
digest emails. Without this backfill, tomorrow's first cron run would
treat them as "never sent" and re-include them.

Idempotent: re-running just refreshes the timestamp on already-marked
rows; rows summarised AFTER this script runs stay NULL until a real
digest send marks them.

Run:
    python tools/backfill_digest_sent.py

Or:
    python tools/backfill_digest_sent.py --dry-run    # report only, no UPDATE
